# Call Transcript Classification Project

## Overview
This project is designed to classify call transcripts into 58 distinct categories, including product inquiries, order updates, payment methods, return requests, and more. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, this project aims to accurately predict query types from conversations, offering key insights for enhancing customer relationship management strategies.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implements a comprehensive cleansing and preparation process for call transcript data, including normalization, stop word removal, part-of-speech (POS) filtering, and stemming.
- **Feature Engineering:** Employs the TFIDF vectorizer for transforming preprocessed text into a suitable format for model training.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes various machine learning classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), to categorize call transcripts.
- **Evaluation:** Measures model performance using accuracy and F1 score metrics on validation datasets to ensure reliability and effectiveness.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A virtual environment (highly recommended) to manage dependencies efficiently, especially given the project's large sample size.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of call transcripts labeled with one of 58 possible categories. Unfortunately the dataset can't be shared publicly due to proprietory reasons.
